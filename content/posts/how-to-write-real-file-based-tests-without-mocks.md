title: How to Write Real File-Based Tests Without Mocks
---

Hey guys, this post is about writing tests for projects that access the file system, reading and writing.

A lot of my past projects in some way had to do with file access. I started to use tools like [mock-fs](https://github.com/tschaub/mock-fs), but soon recognized, that it does not work for all cases, and sometimes you are using CLI tools internally that you cannot mock easily. So I thought of a different solution and the one I'm using right now for most projects actually uses real files.

## with-local-tmp-dir and output-files

I thought: Why not use real files for testing instead of mocking the file system? So I built an NPM package called [with-local-tmp-dir](https://github.com/dword-design/with-local-tmp-dir) that basically creates a temporary subfolder inside your project path, `cd`s into this path, runs a (potentially) async function in it, and `cd`s back to the previous cwd afterwards. In this function you can create files and pretty much anything, run your unit under test, and afterwards everything is cleaned up. You can even instantiate Git repositories, in case your unit under test makes use of Git.

I also wrote another helper package [output-files](https://github.com/dword-design/output-files) that allows us to create a whole file tree at once by passing an object. It's easier than writing a lot of `fs.writeFile` calls.

## Let's Test a Scaffolding Tool!

Alright, let's dive into it! First of all you need a testing framework. I'm going to use [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) here, but you can also use [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) or any other framework of your choice. I'm also using [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) for assertions. After that, we install some packages we need to write our tests:

* [with-local-tmp-dir](https://github.com/dword-design/with-local-tmp-dir) to create our temporary testing folder
* [output-files](https://github.com/dword-design/output-files) to create multiple files at once
* [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) to read files after running the scaffolding tool
* [endent](https://github.com/zhouhanseng/endent) to declare multi-line strings

```bash
$ npm install --dev with-local-tmp-dir output-files fs-extra endent
```

We are going to test a small scaffolding tool that writes config files to disk. If a file already exists, it is not overwritten. Otherwise a default file is created. It's actually not important how it works but how we test it üòÄ.

## Writing the Tests

Let's add a test file:

```js
// index.spec.js

const withLocalTmpDir = require('with-local-tmp-dir')
const outputFiles = require('output-files')
const endent = require('endent')
const expect = require('expect')
const fs = require('fs-extra')

const scaffold = require('.')

it('no existing files', () => withLocalTmpDir(async () => {
  await scaffold()
  expect(await fs.readFile('README.md', 'utf8')).toEqual(endent`
    ## Package

    This is a test package and the doc needs to be written ...
  `)
  expect(await fs.readFile('.configrc.json', 'utf8')).toEqual(endent`
    {
      "name": "Package"
    }
  `)
}))
```

Pretty neat already, we have tested if the scaffolding tool creates a `README.md` and a `.configrc.json` file and checks if the contents are correct!

Now let's add another test that checks if the files are preserved if they already exist. We are going to use `output-files` to write those files:

```js
// index.spec.js

const withLocalTmpDir = require('with-local-tmp-dir')
const outputFiles = require('output-files')
const endent = require('endent')
const expect = require('expect')
const fs = require('fs-extra')

const scaffold = require('.')

it('existing files', () => withLocalTmpDir(async () => {
  await outputFiles({
    'README.md': endent`
      ## My Package

      Here is how to use this package.
    `,
    '.configrc.json': endent`
      {
        "name": "My Package"
      }
    `
  })
  await scaffold()
  expect(await fs.readFile('README.md', 'utf8')).toEqual(endent`
    ## My Package

    Here is how to use this package.
  `)
  expect(await fs.readFile('.configrc.json', 'utf8')).toEqual(endent`
    {
      "name": "My Package"
    }
  `)
}))
```

Great, that's already most of the work! Of course you can go into detail now and write many more tests, but technically that's all it needs. You see, writing file-based tests with these packages is not a lot of more work than without them and you can use real files for your tests.

## Writing Git-Based Tests

The testing setup actually opens up another door: Using Git repositories for tests! I know this sounds a bit unfamiliar, but now that we can write files to disk for our tests, why not `git init` a git repository?

Let's assume that our scaffolding tool makes use of the currently checked out Git repository and puts the origin URL into the `.configrc.json` file. Now we can test if this is working by actually instantiating a Git repository in our testing folder.

```js
// index.spec.js

const withLocalTmpDir = require('with-local-tmp-dir')
const outputFiles = require('output-files')
const endent = require('endent')
const expect = require('expect')
const fs = require('fs-extra')

const scaffold = require('.')

it('repository url', () => withLocalTmpDir(async () => {
  await execa.command('git init')
  await execa.command('git config user.email "foo@bar.de"')
  await execa.command('git config user.name "foo"')
  await execa.command('git remote add origin git@github.com:foo/bar.git')
  await scaffold()
  expect(await fs.readFile('README.md', 'utf8')).toEqual(endent`
    ## My Package

    Here is how to use this package.
  `)
  expect(await fs.readFile('.configrc.json', 'utf8')).toEqual(endent`
    {
      "name": "My Package",
      "repo": "git@github.com:foo/bar.git"
    }
  `)
}))
```
