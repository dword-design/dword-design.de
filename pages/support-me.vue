                <p>Hey there! üôå</p>
                <p>
                  Already big hands for you that you have clicked on the
                  "Support me" link in the navigation bar! This basically means
                  that you think about supporting a developer contributing to
                  the open-source community. So thanks already for this!
                </p>
                <p>
                  My main goal when working on software packages is to
                  open-source it in some way in the future. Sometimes it takes a
                  lot of time and concept, but in the end this is the goal.
                  Firstly, because making them available to others makes them
                  better in the end. Secondly, I'm using a lot of open-source
                  packages for my end-user projects, so I kind of believe in
                  this ecosystem ‚ù§Ô∏è.

            <p>
              Besides putting the packages online, I am very keen on
              actively&nbsp;
              <em>maintaining</em>&nbsp;them over time. There are a lot of great
              tools available for free, but a lot are outdated, which is a pity.
              So one of my principles is to have all packages continuously
              integrated and automatically tested. Also, I'm using&nbsp;

              &nbsp;to keep dependencies up-to-date.

              As you can imagine this takes a lot of time and also resources! ‚öôÔ∏è
